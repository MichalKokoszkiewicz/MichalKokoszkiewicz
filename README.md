# Hi! ðŸ«¡
I have an engineering degree in Computer Science. I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science - specializing in Machine Learning - at the Gdansk University of Technology. My current studies allow me to gain knowledge in Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Parallel Programming and Artificial Intelligence. The main technologies used in which I am developing my skills in this area are Python and frameworks dedicated to it. More precisely, I have knowledge of standard and advanced concepts in the fields of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. At the moment I am developing my skills in efficient processing of various types of data in deep learning. In addition, I am studying and analyzing all types of model architectures and their applications.
