# Hi! ðŸ«¡
I have an engineering degree in Computer Science. I am currently pursuing a Master's of Engineering degree in Computer Science - specializing in Machine Learning - at the Gdansk University of Technology. My current studies allow me to gain knowledge in Data Science, Machine Learning, Parallel Programming and Artificial Intelligence. The main technologies used in which I am developing my skills in this area are Python and the R language. On the other hand, during my undergraduate studies, I was introduced to many areas of computer science, such as front-end and back-end programming in various technologies; Oracle and SQL databases; UML model development; project management; computer architecture and operating systems. Because of my engineering studies, I also have knowledge of mathematics and electronics.
